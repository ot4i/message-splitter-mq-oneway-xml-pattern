<title>Tasks to complete before applying the Message Splitter for WebSphere MQ: one-way (for XML) pattern</title>
<body id="mbi.mrrc.relmq.prereq">
<h1 class="topictitle1">Tasks to complete before applying the <span>Message Splitter for WebSphere MQ: one-way (for XML)</span> pattern</h1>
<div>
<div class="section">
<p class="shortdesc">Before applying the pattern to produce a pattern instance, you must determine
which of the following tasks are required. If required, complete the following tasks:</p>
</div>
<ul><li>Select a unique name for the pattern instance.
You can use the pattern many times and create many different instances, which can be distinguished by
their unique names. Identify the purpose of the pattern application so that you can decide on an appropriate
or meaningful unique name.</li>
<li>Select the WebSphereÂ MQ queue managers and queues that you want the pattern instance to use, 
for example, to receive the XML message. If you are using existing queues, these must be recorded. 
If you want to create new queue managers and queues, you must decide on the names for these resources.</li>
<li> Decide whether validation is required and, either define a message set, or determine the name of the 
message set. After the pattern has been generated, complete the message set creation task.</li>
<li>Identify any additional queue managers and queues that are required for this pattern and decide on 
the names that you want to use. Take into account any policies, standards, or naming conventions that must 
apply.</li>
<li>Decide whether you require logging of incoming messages. 
If logging is required, you must decide to which queue manager and queue the logging messages are sent.
You can send logging messages to a general log queue that is used by multiple message flows, 
or you can use a queue specifically for the pattern instance.</li>
<li>Decide if there are multiple possible destinations and, if so, select the routing approach to use.
	<ul><li>Set the <span class="msobjprop">Routing</span> parameter to 
	<span class="msobjpropval">Specify routes</span>, if you have a limited number of routes where 
	the destinations do not change frequently.</li>
	<li>Set the <span class="msobjprop">Routing</span> parameter to <span class="msobjpropval">Lookup routes</span>, 
	if the set of target routes is not fully determined or might change
	frequently. If this value is selected, the name of the data source must be known.</li>
	</ul></li>
<li>Decide the error handling approach. Decide if you want message elements that cannot be correctly 
routed to cause a complete roll back, or whether it is sufficient to write the failed element to a 
queue for exception processing.</li>
<li>Decide if you want to produce error messages for the pattern instance. 
All data is preserved without error messages because the error actions either preserve elements on a 
queue for this purpose, or roll back the message flow. The incoming message is either returned to the 
incoming queue, or is sent to a backout queue. However, if these queues are not monitored, error 
messages might be required as a notification mechanism.
<p>If you choose to send error messages in the pattern instance, you can turn this function on or 
off by configuring the broker archive (BAR) file before deployment.</p></li>
