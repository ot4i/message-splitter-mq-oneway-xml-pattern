<body id="mbi.mrrc.relmq.postreq">
<h1 class="topictitle1">Tasks to complete after generating the <span>Message Splitter for WebSphere MQ: one-way (for XML)</span> 
pattern</h1>
<p class="shortdesc">Tasks that you must complete after you have generated the pattern.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create the broker archive (BAR) file.
The message flow must be added to a broker archive file. 
Any message sets that are referenced by the flow are automatically added.
<ol>

<li>Click <span class="uicontrol">File &gt; New &gt; BAR File</span>.</li>
<li>Enter the name of your server project or select one from the displayed list. 
The list is filtered to show only projects in the active working set. 
</li>
<li>Enter a name for the BAR file that you are creating.</li>
<li>Click <span class="uicontrol">Finish</span>.
A file with a <span class="filepath">.bar</span> extension is created and is displayed in the 
Broker Administration Navigator view, 
under the Broker Archives folder. The Content editor for the BAR file opens.</li>
<li>On the Prepare tab, select the generated message flow file to add it to your BAR file.</li>
<li>Select <span class="uicontrol">Compile and in-line resources</span> and then click <span class="uicontrol">Build and Save</span> to create your BAR file.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Configure the broker archive file.
Further configuration of the message flow in the broker archive file is not required
before you deploy the message flows for your 
<span>Message Splitter for WebSphere MQ: one-way (for XML)</span> pattern instance, 
but you might want to review some of the default options and configure changes for the your environment.
<p>In the Manage page of the Broker Archive editor:</p>
<ol><li>Optional: Use the <span class="msobjprop">Logging required</span> property to select 
whether logging is on or off for the message splitter message flow.
</li>
<li>Optional: Use the <span class="msobjprop">Error message required</span> property to select whether
error messages are generated for the message splitter message flow.
</li>
<li>Optional: You can also change any of the configurable properties
in the broker archive, for example, properties for security or creating
additional instances. You must ensure that any values you
change do not impact the behavior of the pattern instance.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Create queues. When you apply the pattern, a list of WebSphere MQ queues is generated, with
queue names and queue manager names, which must be created if they do
not already exist. All of the message settings that are required by the pattern are
set explicitly on the messages and are not dependent on queue settings.
<ol>
<li>In the summary file, view the list of queues that you must create. The summary file 
 		is located in the Pattern Configuration folder of the 
 		<i>InstanceName</i> pattern instance project.</li>
<li>Create <span>WebSphere MQ</span> resources. You can create <span>WebSphere MQ</span> resources 
either on the command
line, by using programs and utilities such as <span class="cmdname">runmqsc</span>, or by using the 
<span>WebSphere MQ</span> Explorer graphical interface.
For more information about creating <span>WebSphere MQ</span> resources,
see <cite><span>WebSphereÂ MQ</span> Intercommunication</cite>,
available on the <img src="../images/external_link.gif" alt="This link opens in a new window" class="external_link" />
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/software/integration/wmq/library/" target="_blank">WebSphere MQ
library</a> web page.</li>
<li>If you use the <span class="msobjpropval">Lookup routes</span> value in the 
<span class="msobjprop">Routing</span> parameter, routes can be defined dynamically and are not 
listed in the summary file. When routes are added to the database, the corresponding queues must be created.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Set up a routing database if required.
If the <span class="msobjpropval">Lookup routes</span> value is selected in the 
<span class="msobjprop">Routing</span> parameter, the data source
must be set up with a ROUTING_TABLE table. This table must include the following columns:
<ul>
<li>ROUTING_CONTEXT
<p>Use a value that identifies the routing entries for this flow.</p>
</li>
<li>VARIABLE1
<p>The value that the <span class="msobjprop">KEY1</span> property 
from the message element must match.</p>
</li>
<li>VARIABLE2
<p>The value that the <span class="msobjprop">KEY2</span> property 
from the message element must match.</p>
</li>
<li>QUEUE_MANAGER
<p>The queue manager of the destination.</p>
</li>
<li>QUEUE
<p>The destination queue.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
