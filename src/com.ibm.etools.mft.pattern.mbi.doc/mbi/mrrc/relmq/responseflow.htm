<div><h1 class="topictitle1">Response flow for the <span>Message Correlator for WebSphere MQ: request-response with persistence</span> pattern</h1>
<p class="shortdesc">The Response flow runs as a transactional flow.</p>
<p>When a response is received
from the provider application, the following actions are taken:</p>
<ol>
<li>The message flow includes a subflow called ResponseProcessor.
This subflow contains only a <span>Passthrough</span> node, therefore
no processing is performed. 
You can customize this subflow in your pattern instance to add your own processing
without changing the structure of the pattern. </li>
<li>The saved MQMD header is retrieved from the storage queue and added to the response message so that it 
contains the correct address to respond to the requester.</li>
<li>The response is returned to the requester.</li>
<li>The message flow might contain a subflow for logging, called Log.
You can configure the pattern to include or exclude logging.
If logging is included, the Log subflow is called. 
		</li>
<li>If logging is not included, the message flow ends successfully and the transaction is committed.</li>
<li>The message flow also contains a subflow for error handling. 
</li>
<li>Error messages are written to the error queue, if you have configured
this option for your pattern instance.</li>
