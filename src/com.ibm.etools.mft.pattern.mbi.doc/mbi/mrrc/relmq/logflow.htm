<div><h1 class="topictitle1">Log subflow for the <span>Message Correlator for WebSphere MQ: 
request-response with persistence</span> pattern</h1>
<p class="shortdesc">If the Log subflow is included in the Request flow, the logging of requests is 
controlled by the user-defined property: 
<span class="msobjprop">RequestLoggingOn</span>. If the Log subflow is included in the Response flow, 
the logging of responses is controlled by the user-defined property: 
<span class="msobjprop">ResponseLoggingOn</span>.</p>
<p>If the <span class="msobjprop">RequestLoggingOn</span> property is selected, logging is required, 
the Log subflow is called and ends the flow. If the logging fails, the exception is caught within the 
flow and the information is written to a <span>Trace</span> node.</p>
<p>If logging is included in the Response flow, the Log subflow is called. All errors in logging are caught, 
the flow ends successfully and the flow transaction is committed.</p>
<p>Log messages are written as persistent WebSphere MQ messages to
a <span>WebSphere MQ</span> queue. These log messages are then processed separately in accordance with 
the standard practices within your organization.</p>
The message log contains the original message and the following information in an MQRFH2 header: 
<ul>
<li>Time stamp</li>
<li>Broker name</li>
<li>Message flow name</li>
</ul>
