<span>Message Correlator for WebSphere MQ: request-response with persistence</span> pattern</h1>
<div>
<p class="shortdesc">Tasks that you must complete after you have generated the pattern.</p><ol>
<li>Create the broker archive (BAR) file. 
Add the generated message flow to your BAR file. In the Broker Archive editor, you must select the 
<span class="uicontrol">Compile and in-line resources</span> option before you build the BAR file.
Message sets that are referenced by the flow must also be added.
</li>
<li>Configure the broker archive file. Further configuration of the message flow in the broker archive file 
is not required
before you deploy the message flows for your 
<span>Message Correlator for WebSphere MQ: request-response with persistence</span> pattern instance, 
but you might want to review some of the default options and configure changes for your environment. 
</li>
<li>Create queues. When you apply the pattern, a list of WebSphere MQ queues is generated, with
queue names and queue manager names, which must be created if they do
not already exist. All of the message settings that are required by the pattern are
set explicitly on the messages and are not dependent on queue settings.
		<ol>
		<li>In the summary file, view the list of queues that you must create. The summary file 
 		is located in the Pattern Configuration folder of the 
 		<i>InstanceName</i> pattern instance project.</li>
		<li>Create <span>WebSphere MQ</span> resources. You can create <span>WebSphere MQ</span> resources
		 either on the command
		line by using programs and utilities such as <span class="cmdname">runmqsc</span>, or by using the 
		<span>WebSphere MQ</span> Explorer graphical interface.
		For more information about creating <span>WebSphere MQ</span> resources,
		see <cite><span>WebSphereÂ MQ</span> Intercommunication</cite>,
		available on the  <img src="../../../images/external_link.gif" alt="This link opens in a new window" class="external_link" />
		<a href="http://www.ibm.com/software/integration/wmq/library/" target="_blank">WebSphere MQ
		library</a> web page.</li>
		<li>Configure the input and response queues to have backout
		queues for preservation of messages when errors cause the message flow to be backed out.</li>
		</ol>
</li>
<li>Implement your approach for monitoring and correcting errors.
This might require monitoring the queue for error messages or monitoring the event log and backout queues.</li>  
</ol>
