<div><h1 class="topictitle1">Error subflow for the <span>Message Correlator for WebSphere MQ: request-response with persistence</span> pattern</h1></div>
<p class="shortdesc">If an error is caught during the Request message flow processing, the Error subflow 
is called.</p>
<p>If you have configured the pattern parameters to include error messages and the user-defined property: 
<span class="msobjprop">ErrorLoggingOn</span> is selected, the following actions are taken:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the error occurs during request processing, an error response is returned to the client indicating 
that the message was not successfully sent. 
<p>If the error occurs during response processing, an error response is not returned because the reply 
address is not known.</p>
<p>The following message is an example of a standard XML error message:</p>
<pre>&lt;Error&gt;&lt;Status&gt;-1&lt;/Status&gt;&lt;Text&gt;Failed to send message&lt;/Text&gt;&lt;/Error&gt;</pre>
</li>
<li>An error message is prepared and written to the error queue. Details of the exception are written as 
an XML message. The details include:
	<ul>
	<li>Broker name</li>
	<li>Flow name</li>
	<li>Time stamp</li>
	<li>Summary of the exception data</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>The message flow is rolled back to preserve the data.</li>
<li>The information required for error detection and correction is contained within the error message.</li>
</ol>
