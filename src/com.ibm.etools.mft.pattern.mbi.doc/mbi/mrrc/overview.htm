<h1 class="topictitle1"><span>Message Request Response Correlator</span> pattern</h1>
<div><p class="shortdesc">Use the <span>Message Request Response Correlator</span> pattern to accept requests
from many client applications on a single queue, and to return responses
to the correct client. </p>
<div class="image"><img src="correlator.gif" alt="A diagram showing the behavior of the pattern. A number of requester applications send messages to the broker. The reply address of the requester is stored before the message is forwarded to the provider and restored when a response is received from the provider." /></div></div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">The context</h2>
<p>Client applications often have to access a server application. The requests from the client applications
and the responses from the server can be mediated by being passed through an intermediary or Enterprise 
Service Bus (ESB) such as IBM Integration Bus. The client applications specify in their request the 
specific response queue on which the response is expected to be received.</p>
<p>Messaging systems provide a mechanism for ensuring that the response message in a request-reply
interaction can be routed to the correct originating application or client instance. Typically this 
solution involves passing a 'reply-to address' as part of the message header. The receiving application 
is then able to extract this information and send the response to the appropriate queue. If a mediation 
is introduced into the interaction, two separate request-reply interactions are established and you must 
ensure that the response messages are sent to the correct destination in each case.</p>
<p>If many such clients are interacting with a single server
application, typically only a single mediation is used. Standard practice
is for the server application and the mediation to each provide a
single request queue. The mediation also uses a single response queue
for processing reply messages from the server application. If each
client provides its own response queue, a mechanism is required
to ensure that each reply message is sent to the correct queue.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">The problem</h2>
<p>An IBM Integration flow mediates between a requester and provider. 
The incoming message contains the reply address of the requester, but the message 
that is forwarded to the provider application must contain the reply address of the 
message flow. When the provider application responds to the message flow, it has to match
each response to the request sent by the client. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Selection guidance</h2>
<p>Use this pattern when you have a number of requesters that have to send messages
to a provider; receive responses on a queue that is specific to the requester; and when 
both requests and responses are mediated through the broker. 
You can use the pattern to pass messages of any type, and you have the option to validate 
the message, for example, to protect providers from incorrectly formatted messages. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Solution</h2></div>
<p> The reply-to information from each client request in the mediation flow is
stored before forwarding the message to the provider.
When responses are received from the provider, correlation information is used to retrieve and 
restore the correct reply address of the original requester, and to store this information for 
subsequent retrieval.</p>
