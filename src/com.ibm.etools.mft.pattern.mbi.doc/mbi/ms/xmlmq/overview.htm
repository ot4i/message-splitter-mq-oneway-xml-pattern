<h1 class="topictitle1"><span>Message Splitter for WebSphere MQ: one-way (for XML)</span> pattern</h1>
<div><p class="shortdesc">Use the <span>Message Splitter for WebSphere MQ: one-way (for XML)</span> pattern
to split a large XML message into smaller elements for processing by one or more targets, by using 
transactional flows and persistent WebSphere MQ messages.</p>
</div>
<p>Use this pattern when
you have applications that store information about a number of business transactions and transmit 
this information to one or more target applications in batches.
It can be used to handle large messages without excessive memory use. </p>
<p>This pattern can be used when either the source application or target 
applications cannot make or process
near real-time service calls, or when batching of information is required for business
reasons.

alt="A diagram showing the behavior of the pattern. XML messages are split into smaller elements for processing by one or more targets." />
<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Solution</h2></div>
<p>The solution is to implement a message flow that uses a mutable message tree so that repeatable elements 
can be deleted as they are processed. Partial parsing enables single elements to be parsed as required and, 
because these elements are deleted on completion, the in-memory tree is prevented from growing linearly 
with the number of elements.
As each element is extracted it is routed to the appropriate target application.</p>
