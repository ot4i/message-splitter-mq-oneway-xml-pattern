<h1 class="topictitle1">Constraints on the use of the <span>Message Splitter for WebSphere MQ: one-way (for XML)</span> pattern</h1>
<p class="shortdesc">A number of constraints apply when you use this pattern.</p>
<p>You can use the <span>Message Splitter for WebSphere MQ: one-way (for XML)</span> pattern
only if you are able to meet all of the following constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your requester and provider applications use WebSphere MQ as the transport mechanism.</li>
<li>The incoming messages are well formed XML; that is, XML that parses but does not necessarily validate.</li>
<li>The messages conform to the expected structure. Each input message contains:
	<ul>
	<li>An enclosing envelope, the name of which is optionally identified by a pattern parameter</li>
	<li>A series of repeated structures, with names optionally identified by a pattern parameter</li>
	</ul></li>
	
<li>The incoming message is processed automatically in either of the following ways:
	<ul>
	<li>All of the elements are written to either the output or the bad message queue</li>
	<li>No elements are written and the message is rolled back</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>You can deploy and run the application generated from the pattern instance to a V10 Integration Node that is configured to use the default Queue Manager.
	Select the target Integration Node in the <i>Integration Nodes</i> view and check if the value of the "Queue manager specified on the integration node" in the <i>Properties</i> view.
	If the Queue Manager is not set then you can right-click on the target Integration Node and select "Change" menu to set the Queue Manager name.
</li>

</ul>
<p>It is assumed that this pattern is for distribution of information that must not be lost.
The message flow therefore runs as a transaction and uses persistent messages,
 which has a significant impact on performance but is necessary because no loss of data is a requirement.</p>
<p>It is assumed that the number of repeated elements is less than the maximum number of 
uncommitted messages allowed on the
output queue. It might be necessary to adjust this limit if large numbers of repeats are anticipated.</p>
