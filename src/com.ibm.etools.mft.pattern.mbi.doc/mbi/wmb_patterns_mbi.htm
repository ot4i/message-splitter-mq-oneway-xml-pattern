<div><p class="shortdesc">Message-based Integration is one of the common categories
of patterns for connectivity solutions.</p>
<p>An Enterprise Service Bus can extend an existing messaging infrastructure by providing
an environment for building and deploying message-based
applications at the infrastructure level. Examples of these applications include routing
and transformation services, and logging services. This environment can extend
a single underlying messaging infrastructure or provide a bridge between
different products and technologies. Adapters can be used to provide
access to applications or services that do not have an in-built messaging
capability.</p>
<p>The following diagram illustrates an example of a Message-based Integration scenario:</p>
